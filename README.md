==============

MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) is a widely-used cryptographic hash function with a 128-bit hash value. MD5 has been employed in a wide variety of security applications, and is also commonly used to check the integrity of data. The generated hash is also non-reversable. Data cannot be retrieved from the message digest, the digest uniquely identifies the data.

MD5 was developed by Professor Ronald L. Rivest in 1994. Its 128 bit (16 byte) message digest makes it a faster implementation than SHA-1.

This script is used to process a variable length message into a fixed-length output of 128 bits using the MD5 algorithm. It is fully compatible with UTF-8 encoding. It is very useful when u want to transfer encrypted passwords over the internet. If you plan using UTF-8 encoding in your project don’t forget to set the page encoding to UTF-8 (Content-Type meta tag).
